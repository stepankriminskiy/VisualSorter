# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Description:
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application built using React.js that provides a dynamic and educational way to understand and visualize sorting algorithms. This build has Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.

# Features
1. Visual Representation: Gain insights into sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Selection Sort by observing how they rearrange an array of bars.

2. Customization: Adjust the number of bars on the screen to see how sorting performance varies with different dataset sizes. Control the sorting speed to slow down or speed up the visualization.

3. Algorithm Selection: Choose from a selection of sorting algorithms, each with its unique approach, and watch how they compare in terms of efficiency.

# How To Use:
1.Adjust the "Number of Bars" slider to set the size of the dataset you want to sort.

2.Control the sorting speed with the "Sorting Speed" slider.

3.Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu

4.Click "New Array" to generate a randomized dataset.

5.Click "Start Sorting" to visualize the sorting algorithm in action.
